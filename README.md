# Power BI
# Capstone Project: E-commerce Retail Performance Dashboard (Power BI)
# Situation: Leveraged authentic, anonymized commercial data from a leading e-commerce marketplace that serves as a vital link connecting various businesses to customers, streamlining direct product shipment via logistics partners.

# Task: Designed and developed a comprehensive, single-sheet Power BI dashboard to provide critical business analytics and insights from a complex retail dataset. The dashboard was specifically engineered to answer key strategic questions, including:
Identifying top-performing product categories by total sales.
Analyzing delivery performance by determining the number of delayed orders per category.
Comparing monthly trends of delayed versus on-time deliveries.
Assessing customer preferences through frequently used payment methods.
Highlighting product quality via top and bottom-rated products.
Evaluating regional sales performance through state-wise analysis.
Uncovering seasonal sales patterns and overall revenue trends over time.

# Action :
Utilized Power BI to visualize multi-source e-commerce data and construct an interactive dashboard. My process involved:
Data Modeling: Integrated and prepared 9 distinct datasets to create a cohesive data model.
DAX Formulas & Calculated Metrics: Developed robust DAX expressions to create logical metrics, including calculations for "delayed orders" (comparing actual vs. estimated delivery dates), total sales, revenue over time, and various ratios, ensuring 100% data accuracy.
Visualization Design: Created diverse and intuitive visualizations (e.g., bar charts, pie charts, trend lines, geographical maps) for each analytical question.
Interactive Reporting: Implemented dynamic features such as slicers for user-driven exploration and a drill-through cross-report page for detailed analysis of on-time versus delayed deliveries.
Dashboard Creation: Consolidated all essential charts and insights into a single, cohesive dashboard sheet for a holistic view of performance.
Deliverables: An interactive Power BI dashboard (.pbix file) ready for stakeholder use, accompanied by a detailed report (.doc file) explaining each visual, outlining key insights, and providing actionable findings on sales performance, operational efficiency, and customer behavior.
